<h3>Instructions</h3>
<div>
  <ol>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt the water generously. Add the pasta and cook according to the package directions just until al dente – don’t cook until soft, it will continue cooking in the sauce!</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, slice or crumble the vegan sausage, depending on your variety (Beyond Meat crumbles; Field Roast slices).</li>
    <li>Heat a large nonstick saute pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add a touch of olive oil (if needed) and add the vegan sausage (if you have a good nonstick pan, you likely won't need oil). Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sausage is nicely browned.</li>
    <li>While the sausage is cooking, mix the marinara sauce with the tomato paste, oregano, red pepper flakes, and nutritional yeast and stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Once the sausage is mostly browned, add the spinach or kale and cook for 30-60 seconds until almost wilted but still bright green. Pour in the marinara sauce mixture and toss to combine.</li>
    <li>Use a slotted spoon to transfer the hot cooked pasta from the pot into the saute pan. Toss the pasta with the sauce and sausage and stir to combine for about 1 minute.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle with extra red pepper flakes or black pepper before serving, and top with basil or parsley.</li>
